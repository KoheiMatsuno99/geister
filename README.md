## Game Rules

### Objective
Capture your opponent's ghosts.

### About Ghosts
There are two types of ghosts: red and blue. The type of your opponent's ghosts is hidden until you capture them.

### Escape Squares
The corner squares on your opponent's side are escape squares. If your blue ghost reaches an escape square and is not captured on the next turn, it escapes from the board.

### Win Conditions
You win if you achieve any of the following:
- Capture all of your opponent's blue ghosts
- Lose all of your own red ghosts
- Successfully escape with one of your blue ghosts

### How to Play
Select a ghost by clicking on it, then click on the square you want to move to. If you move to a square occupied by an opponent's ghost, you capture that ghost.
